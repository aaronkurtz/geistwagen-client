GEISTWAGEN

Stone Soup Dungeon Crawl bones sharing

Do you enjoy playing locally but get sick of killing your own
ghosts? Geistwagen fixes that. Upload your own ghosts, download
random people's ghosts and fight other people's failures for a change.

Inspired by Nethack's Hearse.

HOW? 


Short answer:

Run geistwagen. If you're playing on Windows and didn't install the game,
stick it in your Stone Soup folder first.

Quit and run it after you die. That's it.


Long answer:
Geistwagen looks for a geist.lck file in your saves directory when it starts.
If it doesn't find one, it uploads every bones file you have and makes one.

If it does find one, it find any bones files newer than the
lock file. When it finds some, they're uploaded and then
deleted, and a bones file is downloaded from the server.
